# Run Demo

Open this directory in a terminal and run the following npm script commands.

```
$ npm install
```

```
$ npm run webpack
```

then, in another tab/window:

```
$ npm run server
```

This will open a browser window with all of the KUI for React wrapper widgets running in a single page.
